# oneclick-update

> Simple installer downloads and update server

## What it does

Serves updates and installers following the common Squirrel + Electron pattern via Github releases.

In addition to the standard fare of these types of libraries it adds the ability to serve different release channels based on semver build metadata.

`1.0.0+channelName` -> `/download/channelName/win32`

It similarly handles prerelease channels, even prereleases on alternate channels.

`2.0.0-1` -> `/download/prerelease/win32`

`2.0.0-1+channelName` -> `/download/channelName/prerelease/win32`

## Why use this over [hazel](https://github.com/zeit/hazel), [nuts](https://github.com/GitbookIO/nuts), etc...

Both nuts and hazel are excellent libraries. That being said, here are some of the reasons you might use this instead.

- Private repos are a first class citizen, not an afterthought
- It handles multiple builds of the same version (i.e. vendor specific builds)
- It has separate prerelease channels, even vendor specific prerelease channels
- It prioritizes `.dmg` or `.pkg` files for `download/darwin` route
- It allows user defined platforms, for custom asset filtering
- It's a singular standalone script
- It has exactly 0 dependencies
- It is actively maintained

## Install

Just running as a server, use any of these options to download the script. It's standalone.

- [CLICK HERE](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/doesdev/oneclick-update/master/index.js) and save the script where you please
- `curl -o oneclick.js https://raw.githubusercontent.com/doesdev/oneclick-update/master/index.js`

If you're using it as a module, you know the drill.

`npm i -s oneclick-update`

## Usage

Just running as a server, couldn't be simpler.

```sh
curl -o oneclick.js https://raw.githubusercontent.com/doesdev/oneclick-update/master/index.js
SET GITHUB_REPO=doesdev/oneclick-release-test
node oneclick.js
```

Using a private repo, also simple.
```sh
curl -o oneclick.js https://raw.githubusercontent.com/doesdev/oneclick-update/master/index.js
curl -o secrets.json https://raw.githubusercontent.com/doesdev/oneclick-update/master/secrets.example.json
# modify the secrets.json file with your Github oauth token, repo, port, and return URL
node oneclick.js
```

## Environment variables

- `GITHUB_REPO` - Path to Github repo (i.e. `doesdev/oneclick-update`)
- `GITHUB_OAUTH_TOKEN` - [Your Github oauth token](https://help.github.com/en/articles/git-automation-with-oauth-tokens)
- `PORT` - The port you want to run the server on
- `SERVER_URL` - The URL of the update server (for proxying private release assets)
- `REFRESH_CACHE` - Interval to check for new releases as string or ms (default `15 mins`)
- `LOG_DOWNLOADS` - Log downloads to console as `Download for [channel/platform/filename/extension]: [asset]`

## Routes

Detect platform via `user-agent` and download latest installer  
`/download[/channel][/prerelease]`

Download latest installer for specified platform  
`/download[/channel][/prerelease]/:platform`

Get update JSON for specified version, if version matches latest returns no content  
`/update[/channel][/prerelease]/:platform/:version`

Get RELEASES file with `nupkg` download info (Windows only)  
`/update[/channel][/prerelease]/win32/:version/RELEASES`

## API

```js
const { requestHandler, on } = require('oneclick-update')
const config = {
  repo: 'doesdev/oneclick-release-test',
  port: 8082,
  token: 'yourGithubOauthToken',
  serverUrl: 'https://updates.example.com',
  refreshCache: '15 mins',
  logDownloads: false,
  platformFilters: { /* see Platforms below for details */ },
  hostToChannel: {
    /*
      The `hostToChannel` option allows you to treat the hostname as a channel.
      That means you can have `updates.example.com` handle the primary channel
      and `updates.otherhost.com` handle the `otherhost` channel
    */
    'updates.otherhost.com': {
      name: 'otherhost',
      serverUrl: 'https://updates.otherhost.com'
    }
  }
}

const startServer = async () => {
  const handler = await requestHandler(config)
  createServer(handler).listen(config.port, () => {
    console.log(`Update server running on port ${config.port}`)
  })
}

on('download', ({ ip, requestUrl, asset, channel, platform, version }) => {
  console.log(`User at ${ip} downloaded ${asset}`)
})

startServer()
```

## Platforms

Natively supports Windows, OSX and Linux.

Currently arch specification is not fully implemented. That being said you can create your own platform extensions that filter assets as you desire. The intent is to support arch specification natively, but in the interim it could be implemented something like this (assuming you've named Windows x64 assets with `win64` in the name).

```js
const config = {
  platformFilters: {
    win64: (assets, action) => {
      return assets.find((a) => a.name.indexOf('win64') !== -1)
    }
  }
}
```

Similarly you can define any custom platform filtering that you would like. The expectation is the key is what would be specified in the platform part of the URL and the value is a function that filters the assets to the one you would like to use.

The signature of the filtering function is `(assets, action, arch, extension)`

- `assets: Array` - list of Github release assets, the `name` property of each is the filename
- `action: String` - name of current action (`download` or `update`)
- `arch: String` - this is not currently passed, once arch is implemented it will be
- `extension: String` - if extension is specified via querystring, this is it (i.e. `?filetype=dmg` -> `dmg`)
